== Lifetime knowledge

== Size knowledge
=== Fixed
- (max) known at compile time (could use fixed length array)
- known for class of objects early in runtime (can allocate the same size each time)
- known when first using object (arena push)
- max known when starting object, processing done, then actual number known (arena grow to max, then shrink to actual)
- as above, but other stuff allocated in the meantime (multiple arenas or dynamic memory)
- no maximum known when starting, but after processing the size never changes (multiple pushes to arena or dynamic)

=== Dynamic
- array can be added to in any order/at any point
